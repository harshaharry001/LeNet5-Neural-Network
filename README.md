# LeNet5-Neural-Network

#### In this repository we are going to create LeNet5 Neural Network from scratch using datasets from PyTorch *(MNIST dataset)*. We can also see *Hyperparameter Tuning* for efficient performance and also we can see better performance of the neural network.

#### We can see that there is a better performance of this network on MNIST Dataset but it may or may not work efficiently for different datasets. Also we can create another networks for *Image Classification* like *AlexNet*
